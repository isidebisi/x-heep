This report presents the research and development efforts undertaken to port the classic game DOOM to the X-HEEP platform. X-HEEP, a fully open-source RISC-V microcontroller, offers configurability for various hardware implementations, including simulation in software and virtualization using FPGAs. The project leverages the PYNQ-Z2 FPGA to emulate X-HEEP, integrating peripherals such as the Adafruit Bonnet for input and display. Despite significant progress in optimizing RAM usage and interfacing peripherals, DOOM is not yet fully functional on X-HEEP. This report details the challenges encountered, solutions implemented, and future work required to achieve the project's goals.

All the source code for this project can be found in the author's fork \cite{projectRepo} of the original X-HEEP repository.
