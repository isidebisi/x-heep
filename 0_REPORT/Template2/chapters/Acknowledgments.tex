I would like to thank Dr. Jose Miranda and Dr. Miguel Peon for their outstanding help as supervisors for the project. Their availability and knowledge of the subject matter greatly facilitated the advancement of the project. Furthermore, I would like to thank Ruben Rodriguez and Juan Sapriza for their technical insight regarding SPI communication, FPGA emulation, debugging with logic analyzers, and for organizing the X-HEEP agora, an event to exchange advancements made with X-HEEP.
