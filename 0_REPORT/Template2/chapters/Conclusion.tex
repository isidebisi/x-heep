In conclusion, the project to port DOOM to the X-HEEP platform has made significant strides, though it remains incomplete. Key achievements include: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item The creation of a software driver for the Adafruit Bonnet for input and display
    \item Its integration into the DOOM source code alongside other peripherals (SPI, system time)
    \item Removing unnecessary parts of the DOOM source code (sound, network options)
    \item Substantial optimization of RAM usage
\end{itemize}    

However, challenges such as resolving flash memory read issues and further optimizing the code remain.
The project has provided valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of the X-HEEP platform and outlines a roadmap for future work. By addressing these remaining challenges, it is anticipated that DOOM can eventually run on X-HEEP, contributing to the broader effort of demonstrating the flexibility and performance of open-source RISC-V microcontrollers.
