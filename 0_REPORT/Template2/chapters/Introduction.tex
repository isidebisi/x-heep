During the development of HEEPocrates, several critical questions emerged: What will the performance of HEEPocrates be? How well will it run various applications? And most compellingly: \textbf{Does it run DOOM?} \\

This project aims to port DOOM to the X-HEEP platform, an energy-efficient RISC-V microcontroller. Originally released in 1993, DOOM has been adapted for many hardware platforms due to its iconic status and technical demands. The latest implementation of X-HEEP, the HEEPocrates ASIC, presents a modern and intruiging platform for this challenge. \\

To achieve this, the project involves several key components: \\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Developing a display driver to enable output from a screen buffer in X-HEEP.
    \item Porting DOOM to the X-HEEP platform on FPGA, involving modifications to interface files (video, sound, timers, SPI, etc.) and RAM optimization.
    \item Further optimizing RAM usage to facilitate running DOOM on the HEEPocrates ASIC itself.
\end{enumerate}

This report details the progress made, the challenges encountered, and the future work necessary to fully realize DOOM on the X-HEEP platform.
