During the developement of HEEPocrates, the first ASIC implementation of the X-HEEP platform, some questions arose: What will the performance of HEEPocrates be? Does it run well? And most importantly: \textbf{Does it run DOOM ?} \\
This project aims to answer these questions. There are several parts to the project: \\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a display driver to be able to output from a screenbuffer in X-HEEP.
\item Port DOOM into the X-HEEP platform on FPGA by changing Interface files (video, sound, timers, SPI, etc.) and optimizing RAM usage.
\item Optimize RAM usage even more to be able to run it on HEEPocrates itself.
\end{enumerate}
